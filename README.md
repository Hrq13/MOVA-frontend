# MOVA frontend

### This is a SPA I built using JS, Vue.js, Vue router, Quasar, HTML and CSS.
### It consumes an API to get data from countries all around the world and filter them in a table where you can see population, full name, languages spoken in that country, border countries and more.
### It also has mobile compatibily so you should face no problems when using it on your phone.
